# Overview

As a software engineer, I have been focusing on furthering my learning in C++ by building a project that demonstrates various concepts such as classes, file handling, and data structures. This project is a library tracker program where users can add, display, and save books to a file. The goal was to deepen my understanding of C++ syntax, file I/O, and object-oriented programming principles. 

This program allows users to store and manage books using a map structure, and it enables users to save and load the list of books from a text file. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the C++ language and learned about handling input/output, managing dynamic data, and structuring code for real-world applications.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: The program makes use of standard C++ libraries like `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<map>`, and `<string>` for handling basic I/O and file operations.

The project utilizes object-oriented principles with classes to represent books and handle operations like saving and loading from files.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

- [C++ Documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
- [cpp.sh](https://cpp.sh/)

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features that I would like to work on in the future:

- Implement a better user interface for interaction (possibly adding a graphical user interface).
- Add functionality for deleting and editing books from the library.
- Enhance the program's file handling to support different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Implement better error handling and input validation.
